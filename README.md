# bch-dex-taker-ui
This is a fork of [bch-wallet-web3-android](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-web3-android) and is designed to replicate the graphical UI of [bch-dex-ui-v2](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-dex-ui-v2). However, unlike that UI, this one does not need the same back-end infrastructure. This app can communicate directly with the [pay-to-write database (P2WDB)](https://p2wdb.com) to place Counter Offers and purchase tokens.
